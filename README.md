# roadmap
Welcome to my road to Front End Dev! I am an aspiring, self-taught Front-End Web Developer. Realizing that many go down the path I'm on, I decided to document my journey. While no two paths look the same, I hope this provides some context and guidance to someone who, in the future, embarks on the same quest. Enjoy!
